# Corner Grocer
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  This is the corner grocer program. Its purpose is to look through a list of items brought from a store and calculate the number of each item brought.
  
What did you do particularly well?
  To sort my items, I stored them in a map. This map is created at the beginning of the program when the ReadFromFile function is run. Once the map is created, the file is closed, and this map is then used throughout the program.
  I like the way I set this up because I can grab all the needed information from one source.
  
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  The week after I wrote this program, we learned how to use pointers and linked lists. Unfortunately, I had some other personal business to take care of, so I didn't have the time to incorporate what I had just learned.
  To enhance my code, I would rewrite it to use pointers instead and make the program more flexible. Right now, it can only be read from and saved to one file.
  
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  For the most part, creating this program was pretty easy. If I had gone back and created it the way I should have, it probably would've been a bit more challenging but much more rewarding.
  
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  A skill I learned from this class is how to read and write to a file. I knew how to do this because of other courses I took, but it wasn't until this class that I realized how cool that was. I think being able to read and loop through files is an important skill and will transfer well to other projects. 
  
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  To make this program readable and maintainable, I created a new class called storeInventory that will hold all the information about a given store. Every class and function created is stored within its own Header File, making the code easily readable and maintainable.
